        "The model failed on these instances because there was a class imbalance the class \"no\" is in majority hence the model is biased. This can be improved by using resampling techniques such as oversampling the minority class (e.g., using SMOTE) or undersampling the majority class to achieve a more balanced dataset. Additionally, adjusting class weights during model training can help the algorithm focus more on the minority class. Employing ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting can also enhance robustness to class imbalance. Furthermore, we can adjust the classification threshold to improve sensitivity for the minority class and utilize alternative evaluation metrics, such as F1-score and AUC-PR, to better assess performance."
